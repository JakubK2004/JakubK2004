### Hi there!

## I'm a Student, Lifelong Learner, Aspiring Entrepreneur.

I started programming at 12. Started with C++, it gave me PTSD. Did web-dev, hated moving the pixels. Settled on Python because I like snakes.    

Core ideas I subscribe to. 
- Unscripted Entrepreneurschip (Thanks MJ).
- Succes is the progresieve realisaiton of a worthy ideal.
- Why write it in 2 lines if one would suffice?
- Planning isn't overhead, it saves time. 
- If you can't explain it to somebody, you don't understand it.
